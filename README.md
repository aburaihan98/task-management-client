# Task Management Application

## Short Description

This is a Task Management Application that allows users to manage tasks by adding, editing, deleting, and organizing them into categories like **To-Do**, **In Progress**, and **Done**. The application features a drag-and-drop interface and provides real-time synchronization using **WebSockets** or **MongoDB Change Streams**. It's built with **React** for the frontend and **Express.js** for the backend, with **MongoDB** for data persistence.
